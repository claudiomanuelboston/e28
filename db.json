      "sArtistName": "Brian Eno",
      "sBioGraphy": "Brian Peter George St John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno, RDI (/ˈiːnoʊ/; born Brian Peter George Eno, 15 May 1948) is an English musician, record producer, visual artist, and theorist best known for his pioneering work in ambient music and contributions to rock, pop, and electronica.[1] A self-described “non-musician”, Eno has helped introduce unique conceptual approaches and recording techniques to contemporary music.[1][2] He has been described as one of popular music's most influential and innovative figures.[1][3][4] Born in Suffolk, Eno studied painting and experimental music at the art school of Ipswich Civic College in the mid 1960s, and then at Winchester School of Art. He joined glam rock group Roxy Music as synthesiser player in 1971, recording two albums with the group. He departed in 1973 to record a number of solo albums, coining the term “ambient music” to describe his work on releases such as Another Green World (1975) and Music for Airports (1978). He also collaborated with artists such as Robert Fripp, Cluster, Harold Budd, David Bowie, and David Byrne, and produced albums by artists including John Cale, Jon Hassell, Laraaji, Talking Heads and Devo, and the no wave compilation No New York (1978). In subsequent decades, Eno has continued to record solo albums and work with artists including U2, Laurie Anderson, Grace Jones, Slowdive, Coldplay, James Blake, Kevin Shields, and Damon Albarn. Dating back to his time as a student, Eno has also worked in other media, including sound installations and his mid-70s co-development of Oblique Strategies, a deck of cards featuring cryptic aphorisms intended to spur creative thinking. From the 1970s onwards, Eno's installations have included the sails of the Sydney Opera House in 2009 and the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in 2016. An advocate of a range of humanitarian causes, Eno writes on a variety of subjects and is a founding member of the Long Now Foundation.[5] In 2019, Eno was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Roxy Music.[6]",

He is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the late 20th century.[2][3][4] Glass's work has been described as minimal music, having similar qualities to other “minimalist” composers such as La Monte Young, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley.[5] Glass describes himself as a composer of “music with repetitive structures”,[6] which he has helped evolve stylistically.[7][8] Glass founded the Philip Glass Ensemble, with which he still performs on keyboards. He has written numerous operas and musical theatre works, twelve symphonies, eleven concertos, eight string quartets and various other chamber music, and film scores. Three of his film scores have been nominated for Academy Awards.",

      "sArtistName": "Klaus Schulze",
      "sBioGraphy": "Born in Berlin on August 4, 1947, Schulze began his performing career during the '60s, playing guitar, bass, and drums in a variety of local bands. By 1969, he was drumming in Tangerine Dream, appearing a year later on their debut LP, Electronic Meditation. The album was Schulze's lone effort with the group, however, as he soon co-founded Ash Ra Tempel with Manuel Gottsching and Harmut Enke, debuting in 1971 with a self-titled record; again, however, the band format appeared to stifle Schulze, and he mounted a solo career a few months later. While Schulze's previous recorded work had been in a typically noisy Krautrock vein, as a solo artist he quickly became more reflective; although he acquired his first synthesizer in 1972, it did not enter into his solo debut, Irrlicht, whose long, droning pieces were instead assembled from electronic organ, oscillators, and orchestral recordings. The double album Cyborg, his first recording to feature synths, followed in 1973, and a year later he issued Blackdance. Timewind, regarded by many as Schulze's masterpiece, appeared in 1975. Around that same time, he began producing prog rockers the Far East Family Band; the group's keyboardist, who went on to become the new age superstar Kitaro, frequently cited Schulze as the central influence behind his own plunge into the world of synths and electronics.

      "sArtistName": "Tangerine Dream",
      "sBioGraphy": "Tangerine Dream are unquestionably one of the most influential electronic groups of all time. Their music has made an immeasurable impact on ambient, new age, techno, trance, and progressive rock, as well as modern film score composition. Founded as a psychedelic rock group in 1967 by Edgar Froese, the group was initially associated with the Krautrock scene through early abstract albums like 1970's Electronic Meditation and 1972's Zeit. They pioneered the use of sequencers with classic albums like 1974's Phaedra and 1975's Rubycon, which proved to be commercially successful. They became prolific film composers, most notably scoring the 1983 blockbuster Risky Business. Subsequent albums such as 1985's Le Parc and 1988's Optical Race incorporated more digital instrumentation, as well as shorter, more pop-oriented compositions than their earlier epics. During the '90s, albums such as 1995's Tyranny of Beauty were closer to the forms of dance music that Tangerine Dream had heavily influenced. During the 21st century, TD gradually drifted back toward the sequencer-driven sound they had pioneered during the '70s. Froese passed away in 2015, but a trio lineup (including notable electronic musician Ulrich Schnauss) continued to record and perform, remaining true to Froese's vision with the 2017 full-length Quantum Gate.

      "sArtistName": "Chick Corea",
      "sBioGraphy": "Armando Anthony “Chick” Corea (born June 12, 1941) is an American jazz pianist/electric keyboardist and composer.[3] His compositions “Spain”, “500 Miles High”, “La Fiesta” and “Windows”, are considered jazz standards.[4] As a member of Miles Davis's band in the late 1960s, he participated in the birth of jazz fusion. In the 1970s he formed the fusion band Return to Forever.[3] With Herbie Hancock, McCoy Tyner, Keith Jarrett and Bill Evans, he has been described as one of the major jazz piano voices to emerge in the post-John Coltrane era.[5] Corea continued to pursue other collaborations and to explore musical styles throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He is also known for promoting and fundraising for a number of social issues.[6]In the early 1970s, Corea took a profound stylistic turn from avant-garde to a crossover jazz fusion style that incorporated Latin jazz with Return to Forever.[citation needed] Named after their eponymous 1972 album, the band relied on both acoustic and electronic instrumentation and drew upon Latin American styles more than on rock music. On their first two records, Return to Forever consisted of Flora Purim on vocals, Joe Farrell on flute and soprano saxophone, Airto Moreira on drums , and Stanley Clarke on double bass.[3] Drummer Lenny White and guitarist Bill Connors later joined Corea and Clarke to form the second version of the group, which expanded the earlier Latin jazz elements with a more rock and funk-oriented sound inspired by the Mahavishnu Orchestra, led by his Bitches Brew bandmate John McLaughlin. This incarnation of the group recorded the album Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy, before Connors' departure and replacement by Al Di Meola, who was present on the subsequent releases Where Have I Known You Before, No Mystery, and Romantic Warrior. Corea's composition “Spain” appeared on the 1972 Return to Forever album Light as a Feather. This is probably his most popular piece, and it has been recorded by a variety of artists. There are also a variety of recordings by Corea himself. These included an arrangement for piano and symphony orchestra that appeared in 1999 and a collabration with vocalist Bobby McFerrin on the 1992 album Play. Corea usually performs “Spain” with a prelude based on Joaquín Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez (1940), which earlier received a jazz orchestration on Davis and Gil Evans' Sketches of Spain.[citation needed] In 1976, he issued My Spanish Heart, influenced by Latin American music and featuring vocalist Gayle Moran (Corea's wife) and electric violinist Jean-Luc Ponty. The album combined jazz and flamenco, supported by Minimoog backup and a horn section.",
