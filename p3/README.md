## Outside resources
I borrowed the images from google images

I borrowed the biographies text from https://www.allmusic.com

In terms of the pages created I got ideas by visiting different music venues


## Notes for instructor

In Order to run the application execute the following commands

npm install
npm start

Functionality of the Application

Thinking about P4 I begun introducting the following concepts

1) User has the ability to login and logout 

	Created and id /pasword to login in the application
	Email: admin@admin.com
	Password: abcd@1234

2) I loaded predefined data where each musician folder contains
	Pictures (4), Video (playable), Biography
	
3) Pages 

		3.1) Music Hall (ficticious Music Hall) and Home (ficticious Music Hall)
		
		3.2) Create/ Post a Show (Having six fields) that are mandatory ( Show name, Description, Show Date, Ticket price, Genre and Artist.
			 I have populated 4 genres (Jazz / Pop / Rock / Electronic). I have populated 4 musician under Jazz, 5 musicians under Rock, 4 musicians under pop and 4 musicians under Electronic.
			 Musicians are populated under genre selected
		  
		3.3) SHOWS/CALENDAR. Users have the ability to filter musicians by Genre, by selecting a day and clicking on the musician name.
			 Once the musician is selected (Under the 'Heart' symbol you can create a 'Favourites' list, from there you can go back to the post.
			 Or eliminate records from the favorite list. You have the ability to 'iterate' between each post (first, next, back, last)
		3.4) Under INFO, you can see 2 pages FAQ and FOOD MENU
		
		3.5) Favourites page 	
		
		3.6) Logout page
