*Answer the following questions in regards to the student's project you are reviewing. Include context and code examples in your answers when relevant.*


### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?
NO

### Were there any parts of the interface that you found confusing or unclear?
1) When submitting a comment I was hoping to see an acknowlegent regarding my message
2) When submitting a comment I was hoping for the comment itself to disapper after my comment was acknowledged
3) In the 'Raptors' section I didn't see any data at all so I don't see the reason for having that menu entry


### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?
1) With respect to the features, it was mentioned that the data would contain lat/long. I didn't see evidence of that on the application, but I see that data in the json file
2) The code is straightfrward

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?
No, the student used a lot of concepts described in class so I was not that difficult to understand the code

### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?
N/A

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?
In general this was a decent application and met the minimum requirements. 
Used the my-json server for storage for mock server (https://my-json-server.typicode.com/ra1101/e28-p3-api/creatures)
I didn't see evidence for persisted/retrieved data from a local storage.
